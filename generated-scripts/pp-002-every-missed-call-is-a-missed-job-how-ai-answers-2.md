HOOK:
That call you missed while you were on a job site? That was a $15,000 kitchen remodel. Gone. To your competitor. Who answered.

BODY:
Here's the math that keeps contractors up at night: You miss 30% of calls during work hours. Each missed call is a potential job worth thousands. Do that math over a month, a year. It's brutal. But here's what's changed: AI voice agents now answer like a real person. They speak English AND Spanish. They book appointments directly into your calendar. They text the customer a confirmation. All while you're swinging a hammer. The customer thinks they talked to your office. You get the lead in your pipeline. Nobody falls through the cracks.
