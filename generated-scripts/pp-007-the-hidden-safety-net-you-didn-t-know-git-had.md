HOOK:
I almost nuked a client's live website last week. One wrong git push and everything would've been gone. But GitHub saved me—with a feature I didn't even know existed.

BODY:
Here's what happened: I tried to push code, and GitHub blocked it. Why? Because my commits contained my personal email instead of my GitHub email. Privacy protection. Now, most people would be annoyed. But think about it—this is a safety net you didn't configure. GitHub is checking your work before it goes public. The same principle applies to your AI workflows. Build in external validators. Use linters. Use type checking. Let the machines catch what you miss. The best systems don't trust you to be perfect. They assume you'll make mistakes and catch them automatically.

CTA:
Save this for when you need it. And follow for more hidden features that'll save your projects.
