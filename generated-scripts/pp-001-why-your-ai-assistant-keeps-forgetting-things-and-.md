HOOK:
"Hey, can you help me with that thing we discussed yesterday?" And your AI assistant goes... "What thing?" Every. Single. Time. Here's why your AI keeps forgetting everything—and the dead-simple fix that changed how I work.

BODY:
The problem isn't the AI. It's that most AI tools have no memory between sessions. You close the window, context is gone. But here's what the pros do: they create a CLAUDE.md file. It's just a text file that lives in your project folder. Every time you start a session, the AI reads it first. Your conventions, your preferences, your project context—all there. It's like giving your AI assistant a cheat sheet before every conversation. One file. Persistent memory. No more explaining the same thing twice.

CTA:
Drop a "memory" in the comments if you want me to show you exactly how to set this up. And follow for more AI productivity hacks that actually work.
