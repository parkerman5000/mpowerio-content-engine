HOOK:
"Lo siento, no hablo español." How many times has that cost you a job? In construction, half your potential customers speak Spanish. But your phone system doesn't.

BODY:
Here's what's wild: There are 62 million Spanish speakers in the US. In construction, landscaping, home services—that number is even higher. But most businesses? English only. Even their voicemail. You're literally telling half your market: "We can't help you." Now imagine this: Customer calls, AI answers in Spanish. Books the appointment. Sends confirmation—in Spanish. You show up, close the deal. The customer didn't even know they were talking to AI. They just know you were the one business that understood them.

CTA:
Know a contractor who needs this? Tag them. And follow for more on AI that actually helps real businesses.
